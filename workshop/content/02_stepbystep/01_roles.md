### Administrators and Developers

Pipelines does not grant access to all facilities to all users, restricting most configuration facilities to administrator users only. 

Developers (non-administrator users) can create a Pipeline DSL and run their pipelines. To connect Git repositories and other services to Pipelines, a developer will need assistance from an administrator or Project admin.

### Getting Started as an Administrator

An administrator user or Project admin must perform the required procedures that connect Pipelines to the machines and services that enable a pipeline to run.

If your JFrog Platform account has administrator permissions or is a Project admin, you can perform these steps. Otherwise, you will need to have an administrator perform them for you.

To furnish the service connections that allow the example pipeline to run, an administrator user or Project admin must perform these steps:

- Create a Node Pool
- Add Integrations
- Add a Pipeline Source
