### Browse Pipelines

To browse pipelines loaded from configured pipelines sources, in the Application tab go to **Pipelines** | **My Pipelines**. 

After your Git repo has been added as a pipeline source, you can see the "Hello World" application listed in In My Pipelines

### Trigger a Pipeline Run

The pipeline has been defined to trigger execution when a new commit is made to the Git repo.  You can also execute the pipeline by manually triggering the first step.
