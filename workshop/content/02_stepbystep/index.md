<br/>

After you have a Pipelines installation working within the JFrog Platform, you can get started by connecting Pipelines to execution nodes, source repositories and other services. After those essentials are in place, you can start coding (using YAML) and running your pipelines.

This tutorial demonstrates the procedures to get the "Hello World" example pipeline loaded and running. The example is designed to require the bare minimum of integrations and other setup, introduce you to the essential concepts and broadly illustrate the workflow of creating and running a pipeline.

Following these steps is also useful for familiarizing yourself with the Pipelines documentation and its structure within the JFrog Platform documentation.
